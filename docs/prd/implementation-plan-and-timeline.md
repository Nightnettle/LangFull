### Resource Requirements

**Development Team:**
- 1 Full-stack Developer (Primary)
- 1 UI/UX Designer (Part-time, Phases 2-3)
- 1 Japanese Language Expert (Consultant, Phases 2-4)

**Technology Costs (Monthly):**
- Vercel Pro: $20/month
- Supabase Pro: $25/month
- OpenAI API: $50-200/month (usage-based)
- Clerk Pro: $25/month (after free tier)
- Domain & SSL: $15/year

**Total Monthly Operating Cost:** ~$120-245/month

### Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- **OCR Accuracy:** Implement preprocessing and multiple OCR engines as fallback
- **AI Costs:** Implement usage limits and caching to control OpenAI expenses
- **PDF Complexity:** Support multiple PDF formats and provide manual fallbacks

**Market Risks:**
- **User Adoption:** Start with hackathon demo to validate concept
- **Competition:** Focus on Japanese-specific features and superior UX
- **Monetization:** Plan freemium model with premium features
