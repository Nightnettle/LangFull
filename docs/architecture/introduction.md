# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **PDF-to-Anki Japanese Learning Tool**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD analysis, this is a **greenfield project** starting from scratch. However, the PRD specifies a modern JAMstack architecture with Next.js 14 and specific technology choices already defined. 

**Recommendation:** Use **T3 Stack** or **create-next-app** with TypeScript as the foundation, which aligns perfectly with the specified tech stack:
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS (compatible with shadcn/ui)
- Built-in API routes for backend functionality

**Decision:** Greenfield project with Next.js 14 + TypeScript starter template

### Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| January 2025 | 1.0 | Initial architecture design based on PRD v1.0 | Winston (Architect) |

### Stakeholder Analysis Results

**Key Stakeholders and Architecture Alignment:**

- **Japanese Language Learners (Primary Users)**: 8/10 alignment
  - ✅ Fast PDF viewing with React PDF
  - ✅ Real-time highlighting and translation
  - ⚠️ OCR performance uncertainty on mobile (mitigated with PWA capabilities)

- **Development Team**: 8/10 alignment
  - ✅ Familiar Next.js + TypeScript stack
  - ✅ Integrated full-stack development
  - ⚠️ Testing complex OCR workflows (comprehensive testing strategy planned)

- **Product Owner / Business**: 9/10 alignment
  - ✅ Cost-optimized with free client-side OCR
  - ✅ Serverless scaling reduces operational costs
  - ✅ Usage monitoring and billing controls implemented

- **Hackathon Judges**: 9/10 alignment
  - ✅ Innovative client-side Japanese OCR
  - ✅ AI-powered vocabulary extraction
  - ✅ Demo mode with reliable fallbacks

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**High-Risk Areas Identified:**

1. **OCR Accuracy Risk**: Tesseract.js may struggle with complex Japanese layouts
   - **Mitigation**: Hybrid OCR strategy with intelligent routing and server fallback

2. **AI Cost Explosion**: OpenAI API costs could spiral with usage
   - **Mitigation**: Usage caps, caching, prompt optimization, and real-time monitoring

3. **Client-Side Processing Limitations**: Browser OCR may be too slow/unreliable
   - **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement with server-side fallback option

4. **Technology Lock-in**: Heavy dependence on Vercel + Supabase + Clerk ecosystem
   - **Mitigation**: Abstract database/auth layers with clear migration paths
