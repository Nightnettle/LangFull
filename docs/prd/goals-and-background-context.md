# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
Based on your Project Brief, here are the key desired outcomes this PRD will deliver:

- **Eliminate Manual Typing Bottleneck:** Reduce card creation time from 30-60 minutes per chapter to under 10 minutes through intelligent text extraction and correction
- **Preserve Learning Momentum:** Maintain focus on reading comprehension and vocabulary acquisition rather than administrative overhead
- **Deliver Hackathon-Ready MVP:** Create a working demo showcasing PDF → OCR → Correction → Anki cards workflow within the hackathon timeframe
- **Enable Fine-Grained Control:** Provide users with precise control over which content gets processed into flashcards, avoiding bulk processing costs
- **Create Production-Ready Foundation:** Build scalable architecture that can evolve beyond the hackathon into a full-featured learning platform

### Background Context

**The Problem:**
Current Japanese language learning workflows are inefficient and disruptive:
- **Manual Card Creation:** Students spend 30-60 minutes per textbook chapter manually typing vocabulary into Anki
- **Context Loss:** Switching between PDF reader, dictionary, and Anki breaks reading flow and comprehension
- **Inconsistent Quality:** Manual card creation leads to formatting inconsistencies and missed vocabulary
- **High Cognitive Load:** Administrative tasks detract from actual learning and retention

**The Opportunity:**
- **AI-Powered Automation:** Modern OCR and AI can extract and process Japanese text with high accuracy
- **Integrated Learning Experience:** Web-based solution can combine reading, translation, and card creation in one interface
- **Cost-Effective Technology:** Free OCR solutions and affordable AI APIs make this economically viable
- **Growing Market:** Increasing interest in Japanese language learning, especially among digital-native learners

**Success Metrics:**
- **Primary:** Reduce vocabulary card creation time from 45 minutes to under 10 minutes per chapter
- **Secondary:** Achieve 90%+ user satisfaction with card quality and relevance
- **Tertiary:** Demonstrate technical feasibility for production scaling
